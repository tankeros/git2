- Update the Default-First-Site-Name to SiteName: example (HQ-Office)
	Active Directory Sites and Services, rename

- Configure Domain Password and Lockout Policy (GPO)
	The best practice is edit the Default Domain Policy GPO to define the password, account lockout, 
	and kerberos policies for the domain, and nothing else.
	Addtionally, do not define password, account lockout, or kerberos policies for the domain in any other GPO.
- For Additional password policy set fine-grained password policy (password setting object) PSO
	PSO are applied to users or groups.
	Create a new Password Settings from AD Administrator Center (ADAC) System/Password Settings Container
	PSO with the highest precedence (closest to 1) take effect
	If one of more PSOs are linked directly to the user, PSOs linked to group are ignored.
